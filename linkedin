🌟 Day 15 - Transforming Traditional Hamburger Menu into Modern version 🚀

Excited to share an animated section transition where dynamic split text animation staggers on hover for a captivating user experience. It’s perfect for creating engaging experiences for portfolios or agency websites. Inspired by an award-winning website, this project combines dynamic GSAP animations, a innovative method of revealing content with a fluid motion on click and a sleek, responsive design.

💼 I’m actively seeking new job opportunities in creative web development and design, including international roles.
